    <p>The roots of the Crystal Corner Bar date back to one of Madison’s earliest families. Patrick and Margaret Coughlin were early settlers to Middleton in the 1860s. By the 1880s they had moved to Madison and built a homestead at 1222 Williamson Street. Mr. Coughlin was a teamster in the days when that meant driving horses, not trucks.</p>

    <p>The Coughlin family became well-known in Madison's business circles over the next 60 years. Their son, Patrick Jr., ran the Atlas Hotel starting in 1916. His son, Phillip B. Coughlin, would go on to open the tavern that would evolve into the Crystal Corner Bar. Phillip married Florence Koellen in 1917, and together they lived above what would become the bar for over 20 years.</p>

    <p>Florence, daughter of a German army deserter-turned-carpenter, was a trailblazer. In 1935, Phillip opened a tavern called Coughlin’s Tavern. Just three years later, Phillip died, and Florence took over. But the city wouldn’t give her a liquor license—so she had her father-in-law hold it. When he passed in 1944, Florence went to City Hall and became the first woman in Madison to legally hold a liquor license.</p>

    <p>In 1946, Florence married Bob Weber, a Belleville native. She remodeled the bar and renamed it Crystal Corner in 1947, inspired by the light through new glass blocks. Under Florence’s flair and business savvy, the Crystal became one of the most popular taverns in Madison throughout the 1950s.</p>

    <p>After changing hands a few times, including a go-go film machine era in the '70s, the bar found a new identity under Dave Day and Dick Story in 1974. They knocked out walls, added a dance floor and pool tables, and embraced live music starting on a lucky St. Patrick’s Day. Despite setbacks, including a fire in 1988, the Crystal bounced back with a full remodel and a now-iconic sound system.</p>

    <p>To this day, the Crystal Corner Bar remains one of Madison’s most loved venues for live music, while keeping its roots as a neighborhood gathering place.</p>
